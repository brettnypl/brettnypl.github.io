        <h3>Portnoy Pizza Productions was founded in 1989 by Brett Portnoy, a pizza connoisseur from birth. This site is meant to give a (somewhat) unbiased look at the two most popular forms of pizza in the United States: NYC thin crust and Chicago deep dish. We give you a bit of background and discuss the pros and cons of each unique style. We can't tell you which style is better (though you may be able to guess how we feel!), so you'll just have to get out there and try them for yourself! Check out our suggested pizzerias within each city's official page, and enjoy!</h3>
