        <h3>It's safe to say Chicago's famous deep dish pizza isn't without its detractors. However, despite all of this, there are many out there who believe Chicago, not New York, has the best pizza. Deep dish pizza was invented in Chicago in the 1940s and is characterized by its deep, buttery crust, its many layers of sauce, cheese, and toppings, as well as the fact that it is baked in a cast iron skillet. Controversy aside, it's a worthy competitor, and a very unique take on an old classic.</h3>
